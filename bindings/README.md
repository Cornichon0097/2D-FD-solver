# 2D-FD solver

## Description

This directory provides a 2D-FD solver for the time-dependent non-relativistic
Schr√∂dinger equation. The solver is written in C++ but should be called from
Python scripts using bingdings generated by Swig.

## Installation

To install the 2D-FD solver as Python library with bindings, please make sure
Armadillo library and Swig are installed:

```sh
sudo apt install swig libarmadillo-dev
```

It might be some other depedencies to install like Boost library.

If all depedencies are correctly installed, then try to compile the 2D-FD solver
and the Python bindings:

```sh
make bindings
```

If no error occurs, then install Python bindings:


```sh
make install
```

Finally, test the installation:

```sh
make test
```

## Usage

To use the 2D-FD solver in a Python project, just import the `solver` package:

```python
import solver
```
