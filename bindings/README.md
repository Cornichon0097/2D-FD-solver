# 2D-FD solver

## Description

This directory provides a 2D-FD solver for the time-dependent non-relativistic
Schr√∂dinger equation. The solver is written in C++ but should be called from
Python scripts using bingdings generated by Swig.

## Build & install

To install the 2D-FD solver as Python library with bindings, please make sure
Armadillo library and Swig utility are both installed. You also may need to
fulfill other dependencies like the Boost library.

If all depedencies are correctly installed, then try to compile the 2D-FD solver
and create Python bindings:

```sh
make
```

If no error occurs, then install Python bindings:


```sh
make install
```

Finally, test the installation:

```sh
make test
```

## Usage

To use the 2D-FD solver in a Python project, simply import the `solver` package:

```python
import solver
```
